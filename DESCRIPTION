Authors@R: person("Jeff", "Atkins", email = "jwatkins6@vcu.edu", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: A data set of forest structural metrics derived from portable canopy lidar
    data acquired from 2370 transects at 25 sites. This data set includes a 
    Level 1 data product of forest structural complexity measures calculated from
    raw lidar point cloud data using version 2.0.2 of 'forestr'  
    <https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=forestr>. The use and application of this 
    package is detailed in Atkins et al. (2018) <doi:10.1111/2041-210X.13061>.
